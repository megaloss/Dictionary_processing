Dictionary OCR and articles processing

Here I am using pdf2image to covert large PDF file (a scanned dictionary) into separate jpg files and then those files are being "read" using pytesseract OCR.
In jupyter format is the code to convert this dictionary into single articles that are being saved in a large csv file as key (the word) and value (definition).
